**Description:** This is our preferred integration method, offering the highest level of security and a seamless customer experience. It leverages the industry-standard 3-Legged OAuth authorization framework.

**Chase Responsibilities:**

*   Initiates the OAuth flow, redirecting the customer to the Partner's authentication service.
*   Receives the authenticated Member ID from the Partner.
*   Calls the Partner's Membership Upgrade API using the received Member ID.
*   Manages the benefit eligibility check and presents the upgrade option to the customer.

**Partner Responsibilities:**

*   Hosts and maintains an OAuth compliant authentication service.
*   Hosts and maintains the Membership Upgrade API.
*   Returns the authenticated Member ID to Chase upon successful customer login.

**Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security: Eliminates the risk of incorrect or fraudulent Member IDs.
*   Improved customer experience: Streamlined process, no manual entry of Member IDs.
*   Data accuracy: Automated data transfer minimizes errors.

## Pattern 2: 2-Legged Authentication - Simpler, but with Caveats

**Title:** 2-Legged Authentication Integration
**Diagram:** (Your existing sequence flow diagram for 2-Legged Authentication - *Insert Diagram Here*)
**Description:** This pattern offers a simpler integration approach, using 2-legged authentication. However, it places a greater reliance on customer accuracy when providing their Member ID.

**Chase Responsibilities:**

*   Validates benefit eligibility.
*   Collects the Member ID provided by the customer.
*   Calls the Partner's Membership Upgrade API using the provided Member ID.

**Partner Responsibilities:**

*   Hosts and maintains the Membership Upgrade API.

**Challenges:**

*   Risk of incorrect Member IDs: Customers may enter incorrect or invalid IDs.
*   Potential for customer dissatisfaction: Rejections due to incorrect IDs can lead to frustration.
*   Requires robust error handling by the Partner.

## Pattern 3: File-Based Exchange - Batch Processing

**Title:** File-Based Integration
**Diagram:** (Your existing sequence flow diagram for File-Based Exchange - *Insert Diagram Here*)
**Description:** This pattern is suitable for partners who have limitations in supporting real-time API integrations. It involves batch processing of upgrade requests via file exchange.

**Chase Responsibilities:**

*   Collects Member ID upgrade requests from customers.
*   Generates a daily file containing the requests.
*   Securely transmits the file to the Partner.

**Partner Responsibilities:**

*   Receives and processes the daily file of upgrade requests.
*   Updates membership statuses.
*   Generates a confirmation file.
*   Securely transmits the confirmation file to Chase.

**Considerations:**
